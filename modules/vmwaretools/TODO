If you are reading this, then its because you tried to use the rhel5 or rhel6
symlink under the 5.0latest directory (or you are very curious).  We have 
disabled these links due to known bugs during the upgrade process.  Please 
use the release directories instead of the *latest directories to access 
the OSPs for RHEL 5 and 6.

Please see the engineering release note in the docs directory
(../../docs/engineering-release-notes/rhel-upgrade) for more details.

Thanks.

-- Problem --

Updating OSPs from 5.0 GA via "yum update" in RHEL 5.* and 
RHEL 6.0 may fail with unresolved dependency errors.  RHEL 6.1 does not 
have this problem.

-- Workaround --

The workaround depends on which version of the distribution 
you are running.

RHEL 5.0 does not have a fix and upgrade will fail.  VMware recommends 
upgrading to a newer version of the RHEL 5 series.

RHEL 5.1 introduced the yum-kmods package, which will handle kmod 
dependency resolution correctly in the 5.* series.  Install it by 
running "yum install yum-kmods" and then run "yum update" again.

RHEL 6.0 was released with yum version 3.2.17-14.  This version has a 
bug that prevents it from upgrading properly.  Update yum to at least 
version 3.2.29-17 (available for 6.0 updates from the Red Hat Network)

RHEL 6.1 and later have a new enough version of yum and will upgrade 
successfully.
