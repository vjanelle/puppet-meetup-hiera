<aside class="notes">
I'm going to be talking a lot about data in this talk - it's important to know (if you're not familiar with it) what commonly people mean.
<p />Class pararameters and variables - defaults usually, or params pattern.  Facts too - I think?
<p />
Classification - node information, catalog information, facter facts, etc.
<p />
Reports - information after a run
<p />
Stored configs - exported resources distributed between nodes, usually collected with puppetdb now.
<p />
External information - the extlookup function, hiera - functions executed by the parser to help build the catalog.
